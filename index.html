                    From day one, our mission has been to provide our clients with the
                    care and professionalism they deserve; we've been committed to excellence,
                    cleanliness, and incredible service for over 13 years. Since then, our
                    homegrown barbershop has gone from a small, hole-in-the-wall joint to a statewide 
                    household name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The love we've recieved from many of you over the years has gotten us to where we are
                    today: with three different locations across Michigan, a <a href="https://forbes.com">Forbes</a>
                    <em>Golden Cut</em> award, and an incredible base of regular clients. Without you, 
                    we would not be here today. The people of Pemmsbrooke, and of Michigan as a whole, have given us so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we've made the decision to follow CDC guidelines and institute a mandatory mask
                    policy. We now require all staff members and clients to wear facemasks at all times while in the
                    building. In addition, some services will be temporarily suspended, including facial waxing and
                    beard trims. To see the full list of services we offer, as well as the services we've suspended, 
                    please check out our <a href="">Services and Pricing</a> section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thank you for your patience and understanding. This year has been difficult for us all, 
                    but it is our hope that we can brighten your day with our excellent service. Thank you for 
                    all that you've done for us.
